# Zork Discord Bot

This is a discord bot that lets you play the text based rpg from 1977. Just invite the bot to a dicord server and start playing. To activate the bot, use the `!zork` command. All following messages will be interpreted as input for the game.

The bot uses a seperate executable for the game implementation. Communication between the processes is done via stdin/stdout. The bot is written in Typescript.
